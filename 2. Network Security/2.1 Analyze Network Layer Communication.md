## Scenario

You are a cybersecurity analyst working at a company that specializes in providing IT consultant services. Several customers contacted your company to report that they were not able to access the company website www.yummyrecipesforme.com, and saw the error “destination port unreachable” after waiting for the page to load. 

You are tasked with analyzing the situation and determining which network protocol was affected during this incident. To start, you visit the website and you also receive the error “destination port unreachable.” Next, you load your network analyzer tool, tcpdump, and load the webpage again. This time, you receive a lot of packets in your network analyzer. The analyzer shows that when you send UDP packets and receive an ICMP response returned to your host, the results contain an error message: “udp port 53 unreachable.”

# Incident Report: DNS Resolution Failure for www.yummyrecipesforme.com

## 📌 Summary

Several customers reported being unable to access the website **www.yummyrecipesforme.com**, receiving the error:

```
Destination port unreachable
```

As a cybersecurity analyst, an investigation was conducted using `tcpdump` and network diagnostics. The root cause was traced to **UDP port 53 (DNS)** being unreachable.

---

## 🧪 Investigation Steps

1. **Initial Observation:**
   - Attempting to access the site manually reproduced the error: _"Destination port unreachable"_.

2. **Packet Analysis:**
   - Captured network traffic using `tcpdump`.
   - Noticed outbound **UDP packets to port 53**.
   - Received **ICMP error responses** indicating:
     ```
     udp port 53 unreachable
     ```

3. **Interpretation:**
   - Port 53 (used for **DNS resolution**) is either closed, filtered, or the DNS server is not responding.
   - This caused the domain name to fail to resolve to an IP address, rendering the website inaccessible.

---

## 🧠 Root Cause

The DNS service responsible for resolving **www.yummyrecipesforme.com** could not be reached. This was confirmed by ICMP Type 3, Code 3 messages (Destination Unreachable: Port Unreachable) indicating **UDP port 53 is inaccessible**.

---

## 🌐 Affected Protocol

- **DNS (Domain Name System)**
- Protocol runs on: **UDP Port 53**

---

## 🛠️ Recommendations

1. **Verify DNS Server Availability**
   - Ensure DNS servers are online and responsive.
   - Check internal or external DNS service (e.g., BIND, Windows DNS).

2. **Review Network Configuration**
   - Ensure firewalls or security groups are not blocking UDP port 53.
   - Monitor for rate-limiting or blocking by ISPs or cloud providers.

3. **Run Health Checks**
   - Use `dig`, `nslookup`, or `host` to confirm DNS records.
   - Conduct periodic DNS uptime monitoring.

## ✅ Resolution Status

> _Pending – Awaiting confirmation from hosting or DNS service provider._
