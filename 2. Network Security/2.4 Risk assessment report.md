## Scenario 

You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers‚Äô personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future. 
After inspecting the organization‚Äôs network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:
1.	The organization‚Äôs employees' share passwords.
2.	The admin password for the database is set to the default.
3.	The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
4.	Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used. 
If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future. 
In this activity, you will write a security risk assessment to analyze the incident and explain what methods can be used to further secure the network.

# Security Risk Assessment Report: Data Breach at Social Media Organization

## üìå Executive Summary

The organization recently experienced a significant data breach, compromising the personal data of its customers, including names and addresses. A subsequent investigation has identified four critical vulnerabilities in the organization's network and security practices. This report outlines those vulnerabilities, assesses the risk they pose, and recommends effective network hardening strategies to prevent future incidents.

## üîç Identified Vulnerabilities and Risks

1. **Password Sharing Among Employees**
   - **Risk Level:** High
   - **Impact:** Reduces accountability, increases the likelihood of unauthorized access, and makes credential revocation difficult.
   - **Example Threats:** Insider threat, phishing, unauthorized system changes.

2. **Default Admin Password for the Database**
   - **Risk Level:** Critical
   - **Impact:** Allows attackers to easily gain administrative access and exfiltrate or manipulate sensitive data.
   - **Example Threats:** Brute force attacks, credential stuffing.

3. **Lack of Firewall Rules**
   - **Risk Level:** High
   - **Impact:** Exposes the network to unfiltered inbound and outbound traffic, increasing susceptibility to malware, command-and-control traffic, and data exfiltration.
   - **Example Threats:** Unauthorized remote access, lateral movement by attackers.

4. **Absence of Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**
   - **Risk Level:** High
   - **Impact:** Increases risk of account compromise if passwords are stolen or guessed.
   - **Example Threats:** Credential theft, phishing, account takeover.

## üõ°Ô∏è Recommended Network Hardening Practices

### 1. Enforce Individual User Accounts and Strong Password Policies
   - Implement unique credentials for each employee.
   - Use strong password policies: minimum length, complexity, and expiration.
   - Prohibit password reuse and sharing.

### 2. Change Default Credentials Immediately
   - Replace all default passwords, especially for admin accounts.
   - Use password managers to store strong, unique credentials securely.

### 3. Implement Firewall Rules and Segmentation
   - Configure firewalls to control and monitor inbound and outbound traffic.
   - Apply the principle of least privilege to network access.
   - Segment networks by function (e.g., database, application, public zones).

### 4. Deploy Multifactor Authentication (MFA)
   - Require MFA for all employee logins, especially for administrative and remote access.
   - Use TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords) or security keys for stronger MFA.

## ‚úÖ Additional Recommendations

- **Conduct Security Awareness Training:** Educate employees about password hygiene and phishing.
- **Perform Regular Audits:** Review firewall configurations, access controls, and logs.
- **Patch Management:** Regularly update systems and software to fix known vulnerabilities.
- **Monitor and Log Activity:** Implement centralized logging and real-time monitoring for anomaly detection.

## üìÅ Conclusion

This data breach underscores the importance of consistent and proactive security measures. Addressing the identified vulnerabilities through these network hardening practices will significantly reduce the organization's risk exposure and help safeguard customer data in the future.
