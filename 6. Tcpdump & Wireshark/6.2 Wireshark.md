# üê¨ Wireshark ‚Äì Analyze Your First Packet

## üß† Scenario

As a **security analyst**, you're investigating web traffic using **Wireshark** to analyze a `.pcap` file containing user activity on a public website. Understanding how to filter and interpret packet captures is a critical skill for identifying threats and verifying system behavior.

---

## üéØ Objectives

1. Identify source and destination IP addresses.
2. Examine protocols used in the connection.
3. Analyze packet data exchanged during communication.

## üîç Packet Field Reference

| Field       | Description                                                             |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `No`        | Packet index number in the capture file                                 |
| `Time`      | Timestamp of packet capture                                             |
| `Source`    | IP address where the packet originated                                  |
| `Destination` | IP address receiving the packet                                       |
| `Protocol`  | Protocol used (e.g., TCP, HTTP, DNS)                                    |
| `Length`    | Total size of the packet in bytes                                       |
| `Info`      | High-level summary or payload info (parsed by Wireshark)               |

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Identify IP Addresses Involved

Use the Wireshark display filter bar to isolate traffic:

| Filter                      | Purpose                                                |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `ip.addr == 142.250.1.139`  | Match traffic where this IP is source or destination   |
| `ip.src == 142.250.1.139`   | Match packets **from** this IP                         |
| `ip.dst == 142.250.1.139`   | Match packets **to** this IP                           |
| `eth.addr == 42:01:ac:15:e0:02` | Match traffic involving a specific MAC address     |

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Examine Protocol Usage

- When filtering with `ip.addr == 142.250.1.139`, the TCP destination port is **80**, which indicates an HTTP request.

![HTTP Port](https://github.com/Pascal831/Cybersecurity-Foundation/blob/main/Screenshots/Wireshark6.png)

- Filtering by Ethernet MAC address reveals a **TCP connection** between:
  - Source: `172.21.224.2`
  - Destination: `35.235.244.34`

![MAC Protocol](https://github.com/Pascal831/Cybersecurity-Foundation/blob/main/Screenshots/Wireshark7.png)

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Analyze Packet Metadata

Use this filter to isolate HTTP traffic:
```wireshark
tcp.port == 80
```

This shows packets using **TCP port 80**, typically for unsecured HTTP communication.

- üìå **Time to Live (TTL)**: 64  
  - Controls how long a packet stays in the network before being discarded.
- üìå **Frame Number**: 37  
  - Sequence index in the capture.
- üìå **Frame Length**: 54 bytes  
  - Size of the packet, including headers and payload.
