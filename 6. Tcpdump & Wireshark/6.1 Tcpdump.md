# 📡 Tcpdump – Capture Your First Packet


## 🧠 Scenario

You're a **network analyst** tasked with using `tcpdump` to capture and analyze live network traffic on a **Linux virtual machine**. This walkthrough will guide you through identifying interfaces, capturing packets, and analyzing traffic.

> Your user account `analyst` is already logged into a Linux terminal.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Identify available network interfaces
2. Filter and inspect live network traffic
3. Capture traffic to a `.pcap` file
4. Analyze captured packet data

---

## 1️⃣ Identify Network Interfaces

### 🔍 Step 1: Use `ifconfig` to list active interfaces
```bash
ifconfig
```

---

### 🔍 Step 2: Identify capture-capable interfaces
```bash
tcpdump -D
```

## 2️⃣ Inspect Live Network Traffic

### 🛠️ Command:
```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -v -c5
```

| Flag      | Description                                          |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `-i eth0` | Capture from the eth0 interface                      |
| `-v`      | Verbose output (extra packet details)                |
| `-c5`     | Capture exactly 5 packets then stop                  |

## 3️⃣ Capture Network Traffic to a File

### 🛠️ Command:
```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn -c9 port 80 -w capture.pcap &
```

| Flag         | Description                                                                               |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-i eth0`    | Capture from the eth0 interface                                                           |
| `-nn`        | Disable hostname and service name resolution (faster and stealthier)                      |
| `-c9`        | Capture 9 packets                                                                          |
| `port 80`    | Limit capture to HTTP traffic                                                             |
| `-w`         | Write packets to a file (`capture.pcap`)                                                  |
| `&`          | Run in the background so you can execute additional commands during capture               |

### 🌐 Generate Traffic with `curl`

Simulate HTTP traffic for `tcpdump` to capture:
```bash
curl opensource.google.com
```

> This command generates **TCP port 80 traffic** by attempting to connect to a public website.

## 🧠 Notes

- **Hexadecimal (base 16)** uses characters 0-9 and A-F to represent binary data in a human-readable format.
- **ASCII** (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) maps character data to byte values and is useful in inspecting text-based protocols.

## ✅ Summary

| Task                          | Command Example                                          |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Identify interfaces           | `ifconfig`, `tcpdump -D`                                 |
| Live capture                  | `sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -v -c5`                            |
| Capture to file               | `sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn -c9 port 80 -w capture.pcap &` |
| Generate HTTP traffic         | `curl opensource.google.com`                             |

This hands-on tcpdump exercise is fundamental to **network analysis, security investigations**, and **packet forensics**.
