# 🏠 Home Network Device Inventory – Small Business Project

## 🧠 Project Overview

In the modern digital landscape, **information is one of the most valuable assets**. Most information is accessed or shared over a network, which consists of various connected devices. Each of these devices presents a potential entry point for unauthorized access.

As a small business owner working from home, it's critical to **track and protect sensitive assets** connected to your home network. This project creates a structured inventory of such devices to highlight those requiring stronger security controls.
