# 👟 PASTA Threat Modeling – Sneaker App Security Analysis

## 🧠 Scenario

You’re a cybersecurity analyst on a growing security team at a **sneaker enthusiast and collector platform**. The business is preparing to **launch a mobile app** that allows users to **buy and sell sneakers**.

To secure this platform, you apply the **PASTA** (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) framework—a **risk-centric threat modeling methodology**—to evaluate and harden the mobile application before launch.

---

## 🔐 Overview of PASTA Framework

PASTA is a 7-stage methodology designed to simulate threats, analyze vulnerabilities, and identify high-risk areas in application design.

### 📚 Stages of PASTA

1. **Define Business and Security Objectives**
2. **Define the Technical Scope**
3. **Decompose the Application** (DFD/Context Diagrams)
4. **Threat Analysis**
5. **Vulnerability Analysis**
6. **Attack Modeling** (e.g., Attack Trees)
7. **Risk Analysis and Impact**

## 1️⃣ Define Business and Security Objectives

| Business Objective                      | Security Control                                             |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enable transactions                     | One account, one payment method enforcement                  |
| User profile creation                   | Passwords + Multi-Factor Authentication                      |
| Accept various payment methods          | Compliance with **PCI-DSS**                                  |
| Store data in a database                | Protect data with multi-factor authentication                |

---

## 2️⃣ Define the Technical Scope

The technical environment for the mobile app includes:

- **API** for data exchange between customers and staff
- **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)** for encryption
- **SHA-256** for password hashing and protecting sensitive data
- **SQL** for relational data storage and retrieval

---

## 3️⃣ Decompose the Application

### 📊 Context Diagram

| Users        | Admins                |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Add sneakers to cart | Store/update catalogs  |
| Make payments         | Issue invoices         |
| Submit inquiries      | Respond to inquiries   |

_(Level 0 DFD shown; further decomposition can include Level 1 and Level 2)_

---

## 4️⃣ Threat Analysis

Potential threats that may impact the app include:

- **SQL Injection**
- **Session Hijacking**
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS)**
- **Service disruptions from integration issues**

---

## 5️⃣ Vulnerability Analysis

| Vulnerability                        | Explanation                                                  |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lack of Prepared Statements         | Susceptible to SQL Injection                                 |
| Weak Credential Logins              | Brute-force and unauthorized access risks                    |
| Overloaded App Server               | Poor resource management and scalability issues              |
| Broken API Token Authentication     | Leaks, replay attacks, or unauthorized usage                 |

---

## 6️⃣ Attack Modeling

An **Attack Tree** can be used to visualize attack paths.

### Example Root Goal:
🗂 Gain Unauthorized Access to User Accounts

| Branches:
- Exploit broken authentication
- Capture session tokens
- Inject SQL to bypass login
- Phish credentials via fake email

---

## 7️⃣ Risk Analysis & Impact

| Control                         | Purpose                                                     |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SHA-256 Hashing**            | Secure sensitive data                                       |
| **Incident Response Playbook** | Standard operating procedures for incidents                 |
| **Security Policies**          | Enforce password complexity and data access standards       |
| **Least Privilege Principle**  | Limit access based on roles                                 |
| **Zero Trust Model**           | Verify every request before granting access                 |

---

## ✅ Summary

The PASTA framework provides a **structured approach to threat modeling** that considers both **technical and business context**. By applying this methodology, the sneaker company can reduce risk, ensure compliance, and launch their application with strong security foundations.

> This proactive modeling process ensures the app is secure **before** it hits production.
