# 🕵️‍♂️ Caesar Cipher Decryption – Linux Command Line Exercise

## 🧠 Scenario

You've logged in as user `analyst` and discovered that **all files in your home directory have been encrypted**. Your mission: use Linux commands to **decrypt the Caesar cipher and recover hidden messages** from encrypted files.

> 📁 Working Directory: `/home/analyst`

---

## 🗂️ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 🔍 1. Explore the Home Directory
List all visible files:
```bash
ls /home/analyst
```

Inspect the content of the `README.txt` file:
```bash
cat README.txt
```
📌 The message in the file points to a hidden file in the `caesar` subdirectory.

---

### 🕵️ 2. Find a Hidden File

Navigate to the `caesar` subdirectory and list **all files** including hidden ones:
```bash
cd caesar
ls -a
```

Reveal the contents of the hidden file `.leftShift3`:
```bash
cat .leftShift3
```

---

### 🔐 3. Decrypt the Caesar Cipher

The file is encrypted using a **Caesar cipher** with a left shift of 3. Use the `tr` command to decrypt it:
```bash
cat .leftShift3 | tr 'd-za-cD-ZA-C' 'a-zA-Z'
```

📌 The `tr` command maps each character from one set to another. Here, each character is **shifted 3 letters back** in the alphabet.

Example:
- `d` → `a`
- `e` → `b`
- `f` → `c`

---

### 🧾 4. Decrypt the Encrypted Data File

Return to the home directory:
```bash
cd /home/analyst
```

Run the `openssl` command to decrypt the encrypted file:
```bash
openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -a -d -in Q1.encrypted -out Q1.recovered -k ettubrute
```

| Flag         | Purpose                                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-aes-256-cbc` | Use AES-256-CBC encryption algorithm                                   |
| `-pbkdf2`      | Applies PBKDF2 key derivation for enhanced security                    |
| `-a`           | Input/output is base64-encoded                                          |
| `-d`           | Decrypt mode                                                           |
| `-in`          | Specifies input file (`Q1.encrypted`)                                  |
| `-out`         | Specifies output file (`Q1.recovered`)                                 |
| `-k`           | Password used for decryption (`ettubrute`)                             |

---

### 📖 5. Verify Decryption

List the contents of the recovered file:
```bash
ls
cat Q1.recovered
```

🎉 If successful, the original hidden message is now revealed.

---

## ✅ Summary

- A Caesar cipher is a basic encryption technique that shifts characters in the alphabet.
- Linux provides built-in tools like `tr`, `cat`, and `openssl` to **view, translate, and decrypt files**.
- File decryption can involve **classic ciphers** (like Caesar) or **modern symmetric encryption** (like AES).

> This exercise reinforces your ability to identify and recover encrypted data using Linux command-line tools.
