# 💾 Suspicious USB Drive Investigation – Rhetorical Hospital

## 🧠 Scenario Overview

While arriving at work at **Rhetorical Hospital**, you discover a **USB stick with the hospital’s logo** lying in the parking lot. There’s no one nearby, so out of curiosity—and with caution—you bring it back to your office for analysis.

## 🛡️ Safe Analysis Procedure

### 🔐 Environment Used: Virtualization Software

You and your security team analyze the USB drive using a **virtualized environment**. This ensures:
- The drive is isolated from the hospital’s internal systems and network.
- Any potentially malicious software cannot affect live systems.
- Files can be safely explored and extracted for forensic analysis.

> ⚠️ **Best Practice:** Never plug an unknown USB into a production machine. Always use sandboxing or a virtual lab.
