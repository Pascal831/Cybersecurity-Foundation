# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è SIEM with Chronicle ‚Äì Investigating a Phishing Domai

## üîç What is Chronicle?

**Chronicle** is a cloud-native security telemetry platform developed by Google that enables organizations to **store, normalize, and analyze massive volumes of security and network telemetry**.

Chronicle leverages Google's core infrastructure and supports **advanced search capabilities**, including:
- Procedural Filtering
- YARA-L rule language for threat detection
- Unified Data Mode (UDM) for normalized logs
- Raw Log Search for detailed forensic work

## üß† Overview

| Mode             | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **UDM Search**   | Searches structured, indexed data for rapid results                         |
| **Raw Log Search** | Scans unparsed logs using regex and specific field queries (slower)      |

Chronicle allows for:
- Domain and IP intelligence enrichment
- Timeline-based threat investigations
- Asset attribution and HTTP interaction tracing

## üéØ Scenario

You're a **security analyst at a financial services firm**. An alert flags a suspicious domain in a phishing email:  
`signin.office365x24.com`

Your task:
- Determine how widespread this phishing attempt is
- Identify affected employees and assets
- Trace any login submissions to the malicious site

You will use the [Chronicle Demo Platform](https://demo.backstory.chronicle.security/?warstory=) for this investigation.

## ‚úÖ Objectives

- Query threat intelligence on a phishing domain
- Identify which internal assets accessed the domain
- Trace HTTP activity (GET/POST)
- Investigate data exfiltration attempts
- Extract additional malicious indicators

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Domain Search in Chronicle

Search:  
```plaintext
signin.office365x24.com
```

Click the domain result under **DOMAINS** to open the detailed view.

### 2. Launch the Investigation

- ET Intelligence classifies this domain as a **Drop site for logs or stolen credentials**
- Assets observed accessing the domain:
  - `ashton-davidson-pc`
  - `bruce-monroe-pc`
  - `coral-alvarez-pc`
  - `emil-palmer-pc`
  - `jude-reyes-pc`
  - `roger-spence-pc`
- `POST` requests were recorded to:
  - `http://signin.office365x24.com/login.php`
  - `40.100.174.34`
- This suggests **credentials were likely submitted** to a phishing form

---

## üîö Conclusion

Chronicle SIEM provides deep visibility into domain-level activity and asset-level attribution through:
- Rich context from threat intelligence feeds (VirusTotal, WHOIS, ET Intelligence)
- Timeline visualizations of interactions
- Asset-based filtering to quickly identify compromise spread

This investigation confirms that multiple users may have been phished and submitted login data to a **malicious credential harvesting site**.

**Next steps:**
- Quarantine affected assets
- Notify incident response and HR
- Implement DNS and firewall blocks for the domain and its sibling
