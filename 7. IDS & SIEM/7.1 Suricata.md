# 🛡️ Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) – Suricata

Suricata is a powerful **open-source intrusion detection system (IDS)**, **intrusion prevention system (IPS)**, and **network security monitoring (NSM)** engine.

---

## 🔍 What is an IDS?

An **Intrusion Detection System** monitors network/system activities for malicious behavior or policy violations. Suricata helps:
- Detect **suspicious traffic**
- Generate **alerts**
- Log events for **forensics and analysis**

---

## 📚 Suricata Use Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **IDS** | Monitor network traffic and generate alerts |
| **IPS** | Block malicious activity (requires configuration) |
| **NSM** | Save logs and packet data for deep inspection or incident response |

---

## 🧬 Suricata Signature Anatomy

Each **Suricata rule** includes:
1. **Action** – What to do when triggered (e.g., `alert`, `pass`, `drop`)
2. **Header** – Protocol + IPs + Ports + Direction (e.g., `http $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any`)
3. **Rule Options** – Match conditions and metadata (e.g., `msg`, `content`, `sid`, `rev`)

## 🧪 Scenario: Monitor Network Traffic with Suricata

As a **security analyst**, your task is to configure and run Suricata using a `.pcap` file and a custom rule to observe how alerts are triggered and logged.

### 🗂 Files Overview

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `sample.pcap` | Sample packet capture file |
| `custom.rules` | Custom IDS rule set to trigger alerts |
| `fast.log` | Quick alert log (deprecated for production use) |
| `eve.json` | Primary JSON event log for Suricata |

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1️⃣ Examine a Custom Rule

Rule example:
```suricata
alert http $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"GET on wire"; flow:established,to_server; content:"GET"; http_method; sid:12345; rev:3;)
```

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Action** | `alert` – generates an alert |
| **Protocol/Direction** | HTTP traffic from `$HOME_NET` to `$EXTERNAL_NET` |
| **msg** | Displays `"GET on wire"` on trigger |
| **flow** | Packet must be part of an established client-to-server connection |
| **content** | Looks for `"GET"` in the HTTP method |
| **sid** | Rule ID (`12345`) |
| **rev** | Rule revision (`3`) |

### 2️⃣ Run Suricata with Custom Rules

List log directory contents (should be empty initially):
```bash
ls -l /var/log/suricata
```
📸  
![Log Empty](https://github.com/Pascal831/Cybersecurity-Foundation/blob/main/Screenshots/Suricata3.png)

Run Suricata:
```bash
sudo suricata -r sample.pcap -S custom.rules -k none
```

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `-r` | Specify `.pcap` input file |
| `-S` | Specify custom rule file |
| `-k none` | Disable checksum validation |

Re-check log directory:
```bash
ls -l /var/log/suricata
```

View fast.log alerts:
```bash
cat /var/log/suricata/fast.log
```

### 3️⃣ Analyze Events in `eve.json`

Show entire file:
```bash
cat /var/log/suricata/eve.json
```

Format with `jq`:
```bash
jq . /var/log/suricata/eve.json | less
```
📸

Extract specific values:
```bash
jq -c "[.timestamp,.flow_id,.alert.signature,.proto,.dest_ip]" /var/log/suricata/eve.json
```

## 📌 Log Insights

| Metric                 | Value                         |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Severity**           | `3` (as shown in first alert) |
| **Destination IP**     | `142.250.1.102` (last alert)  |
| **Alert Signature**    | `"GET on wire"`               |

## ✅ Expectations

- ✅ Define and test **custom Suricata rules**
- ✅ Simulate traffic using `.pcap` files
- ✅ Analyze alerts via `fast.log` and `eve.json`
- ✅ Use `jq` to filter and parse JSON logs

---

Suricata is a key tool in any **network defense strategy**, capable of both **alerting and blocking** threats. Mastering its logging system provides powerful visibility into **real-time and historical network activity**.
