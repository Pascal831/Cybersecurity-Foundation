# üêß Linux File Permissions

## üß† Overview
In this scenario, we worked in a Linux environment to manage file and directory permissions via the command line using the Bash shell. This is a critical skill in cybersecurity and system administration to maintain confidentiality, integrity, and proper access control.

## üìÅ Understanding File and Directory Listings

### Key Command:
```bash
ls -la
```
- Lists **all files**, including hidden files (those starting with `.`).
- Displays detailed info including permissions, ownership, size, and timestamps.

### Example Output Breakdown:
```bash
drwxr-xr-x 1 user group 4096 May 1 12:00 drafts
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group  123 May 1 12:01 project_k.txt
```
- `.project_x.txt`: A **hidden file** (starts with a dot)
- `drafts/`: A **directory** (`d` in the permission string)
- Files like `project_k.txt`, `project_m.txt`: Regular text files

## üîê Understanding the Permission String

Each file/directory has a **10-character** permission string:

### Example: `drwxr-xr-x`

| Position | Meaning                      | Example     |
|----------|------------------------------|-------------|
| 1        | File type: `d` for dir, `-` for file | `d`         |
| 2‚Äì4      | User permissions (`rwx`)     | `rwx`       |
| 5‚Äì7      | Group permissions (`r-x`)    | `r-x`       |
| 8‚Äì10     | Others permissions (`r-x`)   | `r-x`       |

### Characters:
- `r`: Read
- `w`: Write
- `x`: Execute
- `-`: No permission

## ‚úèÔ∏è Changing Permissions with `chmod`

### Syntax:
```bash
chmod [u/g/o]+[r/w/x] filename
chmod [u/g/o]-[r/w/x] filename
```

| Command                             | Description                              |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `chmod u+w file.txt`               | Add write permission to the user         |
| `chmod g-r file.txt`               | Remove read permission from the group    |
| `chmod o+x script.sh`              | Allow others to execute the script       |

---

## ‚úÖ Applied Changes in Scenario

1. **Remove write from others for `project_k.txt`:**
   ```bash
   chmod o-w project_k.txt
   ```

2. **Remove read from group for `project_m.txt`:**
   ```bash
   chmod g-r project_m.txt
   ```

---

## üìÅ Working with Hidden Files

To modify permissions on hidden files (e.g., `.project_x.txt`):

### Scenario Task:
- Remove write for user and group
- Retain read for group

### Command:
```bash
chmod u-w,g-w,g+r .project_x.txt
```

---

## üìÇ Directory Permissions

Directory permissions affect traversal and listing:

### Example:
```bash
chmod g-x drafts
```
- Removes execute permission for the group on `drafts`, preventing directory access.

---

## üìå Key Takeaways

- `ls -la`: Displays all files, including hidden ones, with full details.
- `chmod`: Core command to adjust file and directory access rights.
- Always review the **permission string** to understand who can do what.
- Use permission changes to enforce **least privilege**.

---

## üìö Numeric `chmod`

You can also use octal (numeric) notation for `chmod`.

| Symbolic | Numeric | Meaning         |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| `rwx`    | `7`     | read, write, execute |
| `rw-`    | `6`     | read, write      |
| `r--`    | `4`     | read only        |
| `---`    | `0`     | no permissions   |

### Example:
```bash
chmod 640 file.txt
```
- User: read/write (6)
- Group: read (4)
- Others: none (0)
