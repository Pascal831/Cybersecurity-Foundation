# 👥 Linux User Management

## 🧠 Overview
This study note outlines how to manage users and groups in a Linux environment using the Bash terminal. You’ll learn how to add and delete users, assign them to primary and secondary groups, manage file ownership, and perform cleanup tasks—all with the power of `sudo`.

## 🧑‍💻 User and Group Management Basics

### 1. **Add a New User**
```bash
sudo useradd researcher9
```

### 2. **Assign a Primary Group**
```bash
sudo usermod -g research_team researcher9
```

> ✅ Alternatively, do both steps at once:
```bash
sudo useradd researcher9 -g research_team
```

### 3. **Add to a Secondary Group**
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G sales_team researcher9
```
- `-a`: Append to group (prevents overwriting)
- `-G`: Specifies the group

## 📂 Manage File Ownership

### 4. **Change File Ownership**
Transfer ownership of a file (e.g., project_r.txt) from one user to another:
```bash
sudo chown researcher9 /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt
```

## ❌ Remove User and Clean Up

### 5. **Delete a User**
```bash
sudo userdel researcher9
```

### 6. **Delete the User’s Group**
> When a user is created, a group with the same name is often created by default. Delete it after removing the user:
```bash
sudo groupdel researcher9
```
