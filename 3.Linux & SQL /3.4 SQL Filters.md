# ðŸ§® SQL Filtering

## ðŸ§  Overview
This study note documents how to use SQL filters to investigate suspicious activity and extract targeted information from tables like `log_in_attempts` and `employee`. The tasks include using SQL operators such as `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and pattern matching with `LIKE`.

## ðŸš¨ Investigating Failed Logins After Hours

### Task:
Retrieve failed login attempts that occurred after **18:00**.

### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_time > '18:00' AND success = 0;
```

- `success = 0`: Failed attempt
- `login_time > '18:00'`: After business hours
- âœ… Result: 19 records

---

## ðŸ“… Investigate Logins on Specific Dates

### Task:
Investigate suspicious activity on or before **2022-05-09**.

### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_date = '2022-05-08' OR login_date = '2022-05-09';
```

- Filters login attempts on two specific days.
- âœ… Result: 75 records

## ðŸŒŽ Filter Login Attempts Outside of Mexico

### Task:
Find all login attempts that **did not originate from Mexico**.

### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE location NOT LIKE 'MEX%';
```

- `NOT LIKE 'MEX%'`: Excludes Mexico or variants like "MEXICO"
- âœ… Result: 144 records

## ðŸ’¼ Find Employees in Marketing (East Building)

### Task:
List employees from the Marketing department in the East building.

### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employee
WHERE department = 'Marketing' AND office LIKE 'East%';
```

- Combines filters using `AND`
- âœ… Result: 7 employees

---

## ðŸ’¹ Filter Employees in Finance or Sales

### Task:
List employees from either the Finance or Sales department.

### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employee
WHERE department = 'Finance' OR department = 'Sales';
```

- Uses `OR` to include multiple departments
- âœ… Result: 71 employees

---

## ðŸš« Exclude Employees from IT

### Task:
List all employees **not** in the IT department.

### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employee
WHERE department != 'IT';
```
_or alternatively:_
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employee
WHERE NOT department = 'IT';
```

## ðŸ§© Summary of Concepts Used

| Concept        | SQL Syntax Example                                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Filter rows    | `WHERE column = 'value'`                                |
| Combine filters (AND) | `WHERE dept = 'Marketing' AND office = 'East'`   |
| Combine filters (OR)  | `WHERE dept = 'Finance' OR dept = 'Sales'`       |
| Negation       | `WHERE NOT condition` or `!=`                           |
| Pattern match  | `LIKE 'MEX%'`                                           |

## ðŸ“Œ Takeaways

- SQL filtering helps **target specific subsets** of data.
- Use logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) for complex filters.
- `%` in `LIKE` helps match **partial strings**.
- Always validate filtered results with the actual number of rows returned.
