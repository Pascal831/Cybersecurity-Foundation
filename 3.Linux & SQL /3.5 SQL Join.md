# üîó SQL JOIN

## üß† Overview
This note focuses on using **SQL JOIN** operations in MariaDB to combine data across two related tables‚Äî`employees` and `machines`. These joins help uncover deeper insights for investigations and reporting within a relational database structure.

## üß© Inner Join

### Task:
Return data that exists **in both** `employees` and `machines` tables.

### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT e.username, e.employee_id, m.operating_system
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN machines m ON e.device_id = m.device_id;
```

### Explanation:
- Returns only rows where `device_id` exists in both tables.
- Resolves ambiguity using the `table.column` notation.
- ‚úÖ Result: 185 matched records with usernames, employee IDs, and OS data.

---

### Enhanced Inner Join Example:
```sql
SELECT e.username, e.employee_id, m.device_id, m.operating_system, e.office
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN machines m ON e.device_id = m.device_id;
```
- Provides more context with additional fields like `office` and `device_id`.

## ‚Ü©Ô∏è LEFT JOIN

### Task:
Return **all records from `machines`**, and matching records from `employees`.

### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM machines m
LEFT JOIN employees e ON m.device_id = e.device_id;
```

### Use Case:
- Useful for identifying **unassigned devices**.
- NULLs in the employee fields indicate machines not currently allocated.
- ‚úÖ Result: 200 rows (including unmatched `machines`).

---

## ‚û°Ô∏è RIGHT JOIN

### Task:
Return **all records from `employees`**, and matching records from `machines`.

### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM machines m
RIGHT JOIN employees e ON m.device_id = e.device_id;
```

### Use Case:
- Useful for identifying **employees without machines**.
- NULLs in the machine fields indicate missing or unassigned devices.
- ‚úÖ Result: 200 rows (including unmatched `employees`).

## üìä Summary of SQL JOIN Types

| JOIN Type     | Description                                                   | Use Case                                      |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| INNER JOIN    | Returns only matching records in both tables                  | Identify fully mapped records                 |
| LEFT JOIN     | Returns all records from the left (first) table               | Find unassigned or unmatched machines         |
| RIGHT JOIN    | Returns all records from the right (second) table             | Find employees missing devices                |

## üìå Tips

- Always use **aliases (`e`, `m`)** for clarity in JOINs.
- Use `table.column` to prevent ambiguity when columns exist in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN** and **RIGHT JOIN** help uncover **NULLs**, which are useful for security audits and asset management.
