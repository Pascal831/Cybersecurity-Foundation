Controls and Compliance Assessment
Case Study
This is based on a fictional company:

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy‚Äôs online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide.

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company‚Äôs infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

Your task is to review the IT manager‚Äôs scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.

Scenario
Botium Toys: Scope, Goals, and Risk Assessment Report

Scope
The scope is defined as the entire security program at Botium Toys. This means all assets need to be assessed alongside internal processes and procedures related to the implementation of controls and compliance best practices.

Goals
Assess existing assets and complete the controls and compliance checklist to determine which controls and compliance best practices need to be implemented to improve Botium Toys‚Äô security posture.

Current assets
Assets managed by the IT Department include:

On-premises equipment for in-office business needs
Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones), remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations, surveillance cameras, etc.
Storefront products available for retail sale on site and online; stored in the company‚Äôs adjoining warehouse
Management of systems, software, and services: accounting, telecommunication, database, security, ecommerce, and inventory management
Internet access
Internal network
Data retention and storage
Legacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems that require human monitoring
Risk assessment
Risk description
Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have all of the proper controls in place and may not be fully compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards.

Control best practices
The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is Identify. Botium Toys will need to dedicate resources to identify assets so they can appropriately manage them. Additionally, they will need to classify existing assets and determine the impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.

Risk score
On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 8, which is fairly high. This is due to a lack of controls and adherence to compliance best practices.

Additional comments
The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as medium, because the IT department does not know which assets would be at risk. The risk to assets or fines from governing bodies is high because Botium Toys does not have all of the necessary controls in place and is not fully adhering to best practices related to compliance regulations that keep critical data private/secure. Review the following bullet points for specific details:

Additional Info
In Cybersecurity, control types can be classified in three ways:

Administrative/Managerial controls
Technical controls
Physical/Operational controls
Control types (providing defense and protecting assets) include, but are not limited to:

Preventative (preventing an incident from occurring in the first place)
Corrective (restoring an asset after an incident)
Detective (Determining whether an incident has occurred or is in progress)
Deterrent (Discouraging attacks)
Controls Assessment Checklist
Does Botium Toys currenly have this control in place?

*SOLUTION*
Based on the case study for Botium Toys, here is a comprehensive Controls and Compliance Checklist aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and best practices in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC):

‚úÖ Controls and Compliance Checklist for Botium Toys (Internal Audit)
üìå 1. IDENTIFY (Asset Management, Risk Management, Governance)
Control/Compliance Area	Type	Control Type	Status	Recommendation
Asset inventory (hardware and software)	Administrative	Preventative	‚ùå Not in place	Create and maintain an up-to-date asset inventory using asset management software.

üîê 2. PROTECT (Access Control, Awareness, Data Security)
Control/Compliance Area	Type	Control Type	Status	Recommendation
User access control (least privilege, account reviews)	Technical	Preventative	‚ùå Not in place	Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and review access quarterly.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)	Technical	Preventative	‚ùå Not enforced	Enforce MFA for remote access and sensitive systems.
Endpoint protection (AV, EDR, patch management)	Technical	Preventative/Corrective	‚ùå Incomplete	Deploy AV/EDR software and automate patching across all devices.
Data encryption (at rest and in transit)	Technical	Preventative	‚ùå Not verified	Ensure encryption is applied to payment systems and customer data.
Security awareness training	Administrative	Deterrent	‚ùå Not conducted	Launch recurring staff security and compliance training programs.

‚ö†Ô∏è Compliance Concerns
PCI DSS: Botium Toys accepts online payments but may not meet PCI DSS requirements due to lack of access control, encryption, and monitoring.

GDPR: Since Botium operates in the E.U., it must ensure proper data collection, consent management, cross-border transfer compliance, and breach notification procedures.

U.S. Regulations: Lack of employee training, written policies, and endpoint security may result in failure to meet U.S. data protection standards (e.g., FTC guidelines).

‚úÖ Summary and Next Steps
Top 3 Priorities:
Create an asset inventory and classification system.

Implement access controls, encryption, and endpoint protection.

Develop incident response and business continuity plans.

Final Risk Score (Post-Audit):
üìâ Target: Reduce from 8 to 4 through phased implementation of controls and compliance measures.
