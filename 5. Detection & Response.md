# Report
## Scenario 

The organization experienced a security incident on January 22, 2024, at 7:20 p.m., PT, during which an individual was able to gain unauthorized access to customer personal identifiable information (PII) and financial information. Approximately 50,000 customer records were affected. The financial impact of the incident is estimated to be $100,000 in direct costs and potential loss of revenue. The incident is now closed and a thorough investigation has been conducted. At approximately 3:13 p.m., PT, on January 20, 2024, an employee received an email from an external email address. The email sender claimed that they had successfully stolen customer data. In exchange for not releasing the data to public forums, the sender requested a $25,000 cryptocurrency payment. The employee assumed the email was spam and deleted it. On January 22, 2024, the same employee received another email from the same sender. This email included a sample of the stolen customer data and an increased payment demand of $50,000. On the same day, the employee notified the security team, who began their investigation into the incident. After a thorough review, the security team found there is a vulnerability in the e-commerce web application. This vulnerability allowed the attacker to perform a forced browsing attack and access customer transaction data by modifying the order number included in the URL string of a purchase confirmation page. The organization collaborated with the public relations department to disclose the data breach and offered free identity protection services to those affected customers. The lesson learned from this incident is performing routine vulnerability scans and penetration testing. The one log that the investigation found is the information of thousands of purchase confirmation pages. In addition, the organization may implement a control mechanism to allow a specific set of URLs to block all requests outside of the URL range and ensure that only authenticated users are authorized to gain access.
