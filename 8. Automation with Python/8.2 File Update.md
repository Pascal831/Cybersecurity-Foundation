# 🛡️ Python Automation: Update an IP Allow List

---

## 🧠 Scenario

You are a security analyst at a healthcare company. Part of your responsibilities includes managing network access to restricted systems containing sensitive patient records. Access is controlled via an **IP-based allow list**.

Your job is to:
- Load the current allow list (`allow_list.txt`)
- Remove specific IP addresses from the list (`remove_list`)
- Update the file with the filtered IPs

---

## 🗂️ Remove List (IPs to Revoke Access)

The following IP addresses need to be removed from the allow list:

- `192.168.97.225`
- `192.168.158.170`
- `192.168.201.40`
- `192.168.58.57`

---

## 📥 Step 1: Import & Read the File Contents

```python
import_file = "allow_list.txt"

with open(import_file, "r") as file: 
    ip_addresses = file.read()

print(ip_addresses)
```

✅ This loads the contents of the allow list and prints the result as a string. There are 17 IPs in the original file.

## 🔄 Step 2: Convert String to List

```python
with open(import_file, "r") as file: 
    ip_addresses = file.read().split()

print(ip_addresses)
```

✅ This uses `.split()` to convert the string of IPs into a Python list. This allows us to manipulate each IP address individually.

📥 Output:
```python
['ip_address', '192.168.25.60', ..., '192.168.69.116']
```

---

## 🧹 Step 3: Remove IPs in the Remove List

```python
remove_list = ["192.168.97.225", "192.168.158.170", "192.168.201.40", "192.168.58.57"]

with open(import_file, "r") as file: 
    ip_addresses = file.read().split()

ip_addresses = [ip for ip in ip_addresses if ip not in remove_list]

print(ip_addresses)
```

✅ This uses **list comprehension** to cleanly remove all matching IPs from the list.

📥 Output:
```python
['ip_address', '192.168.25.60', ..., '192.168.69.116']  # Now 13 IPs remain
```

---

## 📝 Step 4: Update the File With the Revised List

```python
# Convert the list back to a newline-separated string
ip_string = "\n".join(ip_addresses)

# Overwrite the file with the cleaned list
with open(import_file, "w") as file:
    file.write(ip_string)

# Read the updated contents
with open(import_file, "r") as file:
    text = file.read()

print(text)
```

✅ This rewrites the `allow_list.txt` file with the filtered list, placing each IP on a new line.

## ✅ Summary

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1️⃣   | Opened and read the original allow list file |
| 2️⃣   | Converted the file content into a list |
| 3️⃣   | Removed restricted IPs using a `remove_list` |
| 4️⃣   | Rewrote the file with updated entries |

> 📝 Want to compare versions?  
Refer to `allow_list.txt` for the original version and `allow_list_revised.txt` for the updated file.

This script is especially helpful for automating access control in regulated environments where manual updates can lead to errors or missed entries.
