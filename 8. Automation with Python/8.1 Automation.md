# 🏥 Healthcare Access Control - IP Filtering

## Scenario

You're a security professional at a healthcare organization. Your responsibility includes maintaining an `allow_list.txt` file that defines which employees (by IP address) are authorized to access a restricted network with patient records.

Occasionally, IP addresses must be removed from the list—for example, when an employee no longer works with sensitive data. You'll write a Python script to:
- Load the current allow list of IPs
- Remove IPs on a predefined blocklist
- Overwrite the file with the cleaned IP list
- Display the final result

---

## 📁 File Requirements
This code expects:
- `allow_list.txt` in the same directory as the script
- IPs in the file should be space- or newline-separated

---

## 🧪 Python Script

```python
# Define the file and blocklist
allow_list_file = "allow_list.txt"
remove_list = [
    "192.168.97.225", 
    "192.168.158.170", 
    "192.168.201.40", 
    "192.168.58.57"
]

# Step 1: Load the current allow list from file
with open(allow_list_file, "r") as file:
    ip_addresses = file.read().split()

print("Original IPs:")
print(ip_addresses)

# Step 2: Remove any IPs in the remove_list using list comprehension
filtered_ips = [ip for ip in ip_addresses if ip not in remove_list]

print("\nFiltered IPs:")
print(filtered_ips)

# Step 3: Overwrite the file with updated IPs
with open(allow_list_file, "w") as file:
    file.write("\n".join(filtered_ips))

# Step 4: Confirm update
with open(allow_list_file, "r") as file:
    updated_content = file.read()

print("\nUpdated allow_list.txt content:")
print(updated_content)
```

---

## ✅ Output
- Displays original and filtered IP addresses
- Updates the file with only permitted IPs

---

## 🔒 Security Note
Avoid removing items from a list while iterating over it directly. Instead, use list comprehension or create a copy of the list to safely filter items.
