## Professional Statements
I am a passionate and driven cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong interest in protecting digital assets through advanced cloud security practices and comprehensive GRC frameworks. With a growing foundation in threat detection, risk assessment, and regulatory compliance, I am committed to helping organizations build secure, resilient, and compliant environments across their digital infrastructure.

My focus lies in understanding the evolving threat landscape, especially within cloud ecosystems, and applying industry best practices to mitigate risks. I take a proactive approach to security—whether it’s implementing Zero Trust principles, aligning with standards like ISO 27001 and NIST, or supporting audit readiness and policy enforcement. I thrive in collaborative environments where continuous learning and innovation are key, and I am eager to contribute to projects that enhance security posture while ensuring regulatory and organizational compliance.

As I advance my skills and certifications, I aim to bridge technical and strategic security disciplines to support organizations in achieving both operational effectiveness and governance excellence.
