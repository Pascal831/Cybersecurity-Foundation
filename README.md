## üßë‚Äçüíª Professional Statement

I am a passionate cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in digital risk management, cloud security, and GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) practices. My interests lie in understanding today‚Äôs complex threat landscape, especially in cloud environments, and helping organizations proactively mitigate risks using industry-standard frameworks and tools.

Through the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate program, I‚Äôve developed technical expertise in threat detection, incident response, risk assessment, and security auditing. I‚Äôve also gained hands-on experience using tools like Suricata, Wireshark, and Splunk while supporting operational security and compliance initiatives.

I‚Äôm committed to continuously learning, adapting to evolving security trends, and contributing meaningfully to teams focused on protecting digital infrastructure and sensitive information. My goal is to bridge technical and strategic domains of cybersecurity to enable both protection and compliance in modern enterprises.
