# Incident Report: DNS Resolution Failure for www.yummyrecipesforme.com

## 📌 Summary

Several customers reported being unable to access the website **www.yummyrecipesforme.com**, receiving the error:

```
Destination port unreachable
```

As a cybersecurity analyst, an investigation was conducted using `tcpdump` and network diagnostics. The root cause was traced to **UDP port 53 (DNS)** being unreachable.

---

## 🧪 Investigation Steps

1. **Initial Observation:**
   - Attempting to access the site manually reproduced the error: _"Destination port unreachable"_.

2. **Packet Analysis:**
   - Captured network traffic using `tcpdump`.
   - Noticed outbound **UDP packets to port 53**.
   - Received **ICMP error responses** indicating:
     ```
     udp port 53 unreachable
     ```

3. **Interpretation:**
   - Port 53 (used for **DNS resolution**) is either closed, filtered, or the DNS server is not responding.
   - This caused the domain name to fail to resolve to an IP address, rendering the website inaccessible.

---

## 🧠 Root Cause

The DNS service responsible for resolving **www.yummyrecipesforme.com** could not be reached. This was confirmed by ICMP Type 3, Code 3 messages (Destination Unreachable: Port Unreachable) indicating **UDP port 53 is inaccessible**.

---

## 🌐 Affected Protocol

- **DNS (Domain Name System)**
- Protocol runs on: **UDP Port 53**

---

## 🛠️ Recommendations

1. **Verify DNS Server Availability**
   - Ensure DNS servers are online and responsive.
   - Check internal or external DNS service (e.g., BIND, Windows DNS).

2. **Review Network Configuration**
   - Ensure firewalls or security groups are not blocking UDP port 53.
   - Monitor for rate-limiting or blocking by ISPs or cloud providers.

3. **Run Health Checks**
   - Use `dig`, `nslookup`, or `host` to confirm DNS records.
   - Conduct periodic DNS uptime monitoring.
