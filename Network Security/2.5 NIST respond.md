## üìå Executive Summary

On [Insert Date], the organization experienced a **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attack targeting its internal network infrastructure. The attack involved a flood of **ICMP echo requests (pings)**, which overwhelmed unprotected endpoints, resulting in a total service disruption lasting approximately **2 hours**.

---

## üéØ Attack Details

- **Attack Type:** ICMP Flood DDoS
- **Attack Vector:** Ingress via unconfigured firewall
- **Protocol Used:** ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
- **Duration:** Approx. 2 hours
- **Affected Systems:** Internal network, web servers, application servers
- **Root Cause:** Misconfigured firewall rules allowing unrestricted ICMP traffic

| Time (UTC)     | Event Description                                    |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 10:45 AM       | Monitoring detects spike in ICMP traffic             |
| 10:50 AM       | Network services begin to slow                       |
| 11:00 AM       | Internal services become unresponsive                |
| 11:10 AM       | Incident escalated to cybersecurity team             |
| 11:20 AM       | ICMP packets blocked at firewall level               |
| 11:30 AM       | Non-critical services shut down to stabilize network |
| 12:15 PM       | Critical services restored                           |
| 12:45 PM       | Full incident containment achieved                   |

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The attacker exploited an **unconfigured firewall**, which did not enforce restrictions on ICMP traffic. This allowed malicious actors to send a flood of echo requests, resulting in resource exhaustion and service downtime.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Mitigation Actions

### Immediate
- Blocked incoming ICMP packets
- Disabled non-essential services
- Prioritized restoration of business-critical systems

### Post-Incident
- Configured rate-limiting for ICMP on the firewall
- Enabled source IP verification
- Deployed intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
- Enhanced traffic monitoring with real-time alerts
- Implemented network behavior analytics for anomaly detection

## üß© NIST CSF Alignment

| Function | Action Taken |
|----------|--------------|
| Identify | Conducted internal audit and asset discovery |
| Protect  | Updated firewall rules and enforced policy controls |
| Detect   | Improved SIEM integration and alert thresholds |
| Respond  | Followed Incident Response Plan and documented actions |
| Recover  | Initiated backup restore checks and post-incident debrief |

## üß† Lessons Learned

- **Default configurations are risky.** Firewall baselines must be verified before deployment.
- **ICMP should not be exposed** without strict rate controls and filtering.
- **Monitoring must be proactive**, not reactive.
- **Redundancy in network architecture** helps minimize blast radius in DDoS scenarios.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

- Enforce baseline firewall policies company-wide
- Run monthly DDoS simulations as part of incident response training
- Deploy upstream DDoS protection (e.g., via ISP or CDN)
- Regularly update detection rules in SIEM and IDS/IPS tools
