## Scenario 

You are a cybersecurity analyst working for a multimedia company that offers web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions to small businesses. Your organization recently experienced a DDoS attack, which compromised the internal network for two hours until it was resolved.
During the attack, your organization‚Äôs network services suddenly stopped responding due to an incoming flood of ICMP packets. Normal internal network traffic could not access any network resources. The incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, stopping all non-critical network services offline, and restoring critical network services. 
The company‚Äôs cybersecurity team then investigated the security event. They found that a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings into the company‚Äôs network through an unconfigured firewall. This vulnerability allowed the malicious attacker to overwhelm the company‚Äôs network through a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. 
To address this security event, the network security team implemented: 
A new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets
Source IP address verification on the firewall to check for spoofed IP addresses on incoming ICMP packets
Network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns
An IDS/IPS system to filter out some ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics
As a cybersecurity analyst, you are tasked with using this security event to create a plan to improve your company‚Äôs network security, following the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). You will use the CSF to help you navigate through the different steps of analyzing this cybersecurity incident and integrate your analysis into a general security strategy:

1. Identify security risks through regular audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to identify potential gaps in security. 
2. Protect internal assets through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats. 
3. Detect potential security incidents and improve monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections. 
4. Respond to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents; implement improvements to the security process. 
5. Recover affected systems to normal operation and restore systems data and/or assets that have been affected by an incident.


# üö® Incident Report: ICMP Flood DDoS Attack

## üìå Executive Summary

On February 15, 2025, the organization experienced a **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attack targeting its internal network infrastructure. The attack involved a flood of **ICMP echo requests (pings)**, which overwhelmed unprotected endpoints, resulting in a total service disruption lasting approximately **2 hours**.

---

## üéØ Attack Details

- **Attack Type:** ICMP Flood DDoS
- **Attack Vector:** Ingress via unconfigured firewall
- **Protocol Used:** ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
- **Duration:** Approx. 2 hours
- **Affected Systems:** Internal network, web servers, application servers
- **Root Cause:** Misconfigured firewall rules allowing unrestricted ICMP traffic

| Time (UTC)     | Event Description                                    |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 10:45 AM       | Monitoring detects spike in ICMP traffic             |
| 10:50 AM       | Network services begin to slow                       |
| 11:00 AM       | Internal services become unresponsive                |
| 11:10 AM       | Incident escalated to cybersecurity team             |
| 11:20 AM       | ICMP packets blocked at firewall level               |
| 11:30 AM       | Non-critical services shut down to stabilize network |
| 12:15 PM       | Critical services restored                           |
| 12:45 PM       | Full incident containment achieved                   |

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The attacker exploited an **unconfigured firewall**, which did not enforce restrictions on ICMP traffic. This allowed malicious actors to send a flood of echo requests, resulting in resource exhaustion and service downtime.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Mitigation Actions

### Immediate
- Blocked incoming ICMP packets
- Disabled non-essential services
- Prioritized restoration of business-critical systems

### Post-Incident
- Configured rate-limiting for ICMP on the firewall
- Enabled source IP verification
- Deployed intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
- Enhanced traffic monitoring with real-time alerts
- Implemented network behavior analytics for anomaly detection

## üß© NIST CSF Alignment

| Function | Action Taken |
|----------|--------------|
| Identify | Conducted internal audit and asset discovery |
| Protect  | Updated firewall rules and enforced policy controls |
| Detect   | Improved SIEM integration and alert thresholds |
| Respond  | Followed Incident Response Plan and documented actions |
| Recover  | Initiated backup restore checks and post-incident debrief |

## üß† Lessons Learned

- **Default configurations are risky.** Firewall baselines must be verified before deployment.
- **ICMP should not be exposed** without strict rate controls and filtering.
- **Monitoring must be proactive**, not reactive.
- **Redundancy in network architecture** helps minimize blast radius in DDoS scenarios.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

- Enforce baseline firewall policies company-wide
- Run monthly DDoS simulations as part of incident response training
- Deploy upstream DDoS protection (e.g., via ISP or CDN)
- Regularly update detection rules in SIEM and IDS/IPS tools
